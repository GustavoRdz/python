# What is a dynamically typed language?
Before we understand a dynamically typed language, we should learn about what typing is. <em>Typing</em> refers to type-checking in programming languages. In a <em>strongly-typed</em> language, such as Python, <b>"1" + 2</b> will result in a type error since these languages don't allow for "type-coercion" (implicit conversion of data types). On the other hand, a <b>weakly-typed</b> language, such as Javascript, will simply output <b>"12"</b> as result.

Type-checking can be done at two stages -

+ <b>Static</b> - Data Types are checked before execution.
+ <b>Dynamic</b> - Data Types are checked during execution.

Python is an interpreted language, executes each statement line by line and thus type-checking is done on the fly, during execution. Hence, Python is a Dynamically Typed Language.
